# a method that returns the sum of two integers

START define a method name sum with 2 parameters
GET the value of the two parse parameters and add them using + operator
PRINT the result of the 2 added numbers

a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a 
string that is all those strings concatenated together
=end

START 
# Given a string of array 
# Create an empty string 

READ the value of the array using each method and use the merge() method 
and append them to the new array
PRINT the result of the new array

Now, let's suppose that the above flowchart is mapping out a solution to part of a
larger problem. Let's suppose that in our larger problem, we're asking the 
user to give us N collections of numbers. We want to take the largest number
out of each collection, and display it.
=end


while user wants to keep going
  - ask the user for a collection of numbers
  - extract the largest one from that collection and save it
  - ask the user if they want to input another collection

return saved list of numbers

# calculator

- Get the first number
  - Make sure it's valid, otherwise, ask for another
- Get the second number
  - Make sure it's valid, otherwise, ask for another
- Get the operator
  - Make sure it's valid, otherwise, ask again

- Perform operation on the two numbers
- Display result
- Ask if user wants to do another calculation
